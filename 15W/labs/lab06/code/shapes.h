// A struct is a way of defining a new data type.
// In C/C++, we have int, double, char etc.
// We can also define a new data type by grouping several items together
//  and giving each part of the struct a name.
// The parts of a struct are called "members" of that struct

struct Point {
  double x;
  double y;
}; // Now we can declare data items of type "struct Point".

// Don't forget the closing semicolon on your struct definitions.

// In anticipation of doing some graphics programming,
// we are going to define a Box as a special case of a Rectangle.
// What is special about a Box is that its sides are parallel to 
// x and y axes.    Note that we can have a struct inside a struct!

struct Box {
  Point ul; // upper left corner
  double width;
  double height;
}; // Now we can declare data items of type "struct Box"
