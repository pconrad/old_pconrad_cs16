<p align="center" class="style2">This assignment is due <strong>IN Lecture on Thursday. </strong><br />

<hr />
<p>As promised last week, starting today, you need the official textbook for this course by Delores Etter.</p>
<div id="bookstoreMemo"></div>
<p>The textbook is not yet on reserve in the library, but should be soon. In the meantime, if you want to read a copy, you can come to my office hours, or those of your TA and read a copy there. </p>
<p>For Thursday, read sections 1.3, 2.1-2.4, 3.1-3.4, 4.1-4.2—These are the sections covered on the first midterm. They are mostly review of material covered in lecture already.</p>
<p>Then, answer these questions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Section 1.3 presents  a five step problem solving methodology in the context of a program that calculates the distance between two points.<br />
      <br />
    <br />
      <ol>
        <li>(5 pts) What is the formula that is used to calculate this distance? Describe it in math notation, rather than in C.<br />
          <br />  
          <br />  
        </li>
        <li>(5 pts) How does this formula look after it is converted into C code?<br />  
          <br />  
          <br />  
          <br />
        </li>
      </ol>
       <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:larger;">Please turn over for questions to answer</span><br />
    </p>

    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Section 2.1 begins with a review of the C program solution to the problem outlined in Section 1.3, including a review of each line of code and its purpose in the program. This description includes many defintions of technical terms. <br />
    <br />
    
    These technical terms are helpful to know, because when your program contains syntax errors, the resulting error messages often contain these technical terms.<br />
      <br />
      <ol>
        <li>(5 pts) Which of the lines of code is a <em>pre-processor directive</em> that pulls in information related to the square root function?<br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>(5 pts) Section 2.1 describes declarations and statements. <br />
          <br />
          Java and C++ also have declarations and statements—in those languages, the two can be interleaved in many different orders. That is not true in C, though. <br />
          <br />
          Instead, in C, which must come first: declarations, or statements? <br />
          <br />
        </li>
      </ol>
        <p><br />
    </p>
  </li>
<li>(5 pts) In Section 2.2, the author mentions the C is a case-sensitive language. What does this mean? <br />
  <br />
  <br />  
  <br />
</li>
<li>Section 2.3 discusses both unary operators and binary operators.
  <br />
  <br />
  <ol>
    <li>(2 pts) Give an example of a unary operator<br />
        <br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>(3 pts) Give an example an a binary operator<br />
      <br />
      <br />
    </li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>Section 3.2 describes conditional expressions, relational operators, and logical operators<br />
    <br />
  <ol>
    <li>(2 pts) Give an example of a relational operator, and describe its meaning in plain english<br />
      <br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>(3 pts) Give an example of a logical operator, and describe its meaning in plain english</li>
  </ol>
</li>
