    <br />
    <strong>Personal Day/Sick Day policy</strong>: Everyone is permitted one &quot;personal day/sick day&quot; when you get to make up a missed homework assignment for free during office hours or via appointment. After that, you may not make up the homework assignment—you can only earn back the points through extra credit opportunities.</span></p>

<p>For this assignment, the reading is a handout that was distributed in lecture, and is also available online at this link:<br />
    <a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/cs16/10W/homework/H03/handout">http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/cs16/10W/homework/H03/handout</a><br />
</p>
<p>Once you've read that handout, write answers to the questions on the reverse side of this sheet (use the <a href="H01.pdf">PDF link</a> to print a copy of this if you weren't in class).</p>
<ol>
  <li>(10 pts) Write a C function definition for a function called areaOfTriangle that returns the area of a triangle as a real number. The function should take two parameters that are both real numbers, namely base and height. The formula for area of a triangle is 1/2 base times height.<br />
      <br />

          </p>
    </li>
    <li>(10 pts) Write a C function called howManyEggs that return an integer. The function should take a integer parameter called dozens, and return the value of that parameter, multiplied by 12.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
      <br />
      <br />
  </li>
<li>(10 pts) Write a C function that takes the radius of a circle as a parameter (a real number) and returns the area of that circle. Use the value 3.14159 for pi.<br />
  <br />
  (Note: in a real program we'd probably want to use 3.141592653589793238462643—that's more like the accuracy that a double value can hold, but that's too much to expect you to write out for a homework assignment.)<br />

      </li>
  
  <li>(10 pts) Write a C function that takes a value in inches and returns the corresponding value in centimeters. You choose an appropriate name, and a name for the parameter. The conversion factor is 1in = 2.54 cm. <br />
