<hr />
<p>Please obtain the official textbook for this course by Delores Etter. <strong>You will start having homework assignments in that book next week.</strong> (I've delayed this one additional class period since the book is not yet on reserve at the library.)</p>
<p>For today, this handout is your reading assignment to go with H04. If you have the official textbook, sections 2.1 and 2.1 will help you complete this assignment.</p>
<hr />
<p>Homework H04  is about the following terminology:</p>
<ul>
  <li>operator
    <ul>
      <li>unary operator</li>
      <li>binary operator</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>operand
    <ul>
      <li>left operand</li>
      <li>right operand</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>It is also a check on whether you understand the concept of operator prededence, and the notion of type.</p>
<p>Here are several sample questions and answers, and an explanation of each. From those, and the material in lecture, you should be able to answer the homework problems.</p>
<p><strong>Question: </strong>Given the expression 2 + 3 * 5</p>
<ol>
  <li>What is the value of the expression?</li>
  <li>What is the type of the expression?</li>
  <li>How many binary operators are in this expression?</li>
  <li>What is the left operand of the * operator?</li>
  <li>What is the right operand of the + operator?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>s:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The value is 17. This is because the first operation performed is the 3 * 5, which results in an int value 15. The next operation performed is 2 + 15, resulting in 17, which is an int.</li>
  <li>The expression is of type int (see above)</li>
  <li>There are two binary operators, + and *. A binary operator is an operator that takes two operands. Operands are the things the operator operates on to produce a result.</li>
  <li>The left operand of the * operator is 3. (The right operator would be 5)</li>
  <li>The right operand is actually <em>the result of (3 * 5)</em>. I would also accept the answer &quot;15&quot;.<br />
  Note that 3 is not a correct answer, because we do not add 2 and 3.<br />
  (The left operand of the + is of course 2).</li>

    <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:larger;">Continued from other side</span></p>
<p>Here's another example:</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Given the expression 5 == (2 + 2)</p>
<ol>
  <li>What is the value of the expression?</li>
  <li>What is the type of the expression?</li>
  <li>How many binary operators are in this expression?</li>
  <li>What are the operands of the == operator?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The value is 0. The first operation performed is the 2 + 2 which results in an int value 4. The next operation performed is 5 == 4, which results in the int value 0 (boolean values are treated as int values in C, with 0 representing false, and 1 representing true.)</li>
  <li>The expression is technically of type int, although I might also accept &quot;boolean&quot;.</li>
  <li>There are two binary operators, == and +. A binary operator is an operator that takes two operands. Operands are the things the operator operates on to produce a result.</li>
  <li>The operands of the == operator are 5 (which is the left operand) and &quot;the result of (2+2)&quot; (which is the right operand).</li>
  </ol>
<p>Here's another example:</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Suppose that x is a variable of type int, with the value 6, and y is variable of type int with the value 4.</p>
<p>In the expression x = -y</p>
<ol>
  <li>What is the value of the expression?</li>
  <li>What is the type of the expression?</li>
  <li>How many binary operators are in this expression?</li>
  <li>How many unary operators are in this expression?</li>
  <li>What is the operand of the unary operator?</li>
  <li>What are the operands of the binary operator</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: that I have left out the ; deliberately here—this is an expression, not necessarily a statement. This expression could be turned into an assignment statement, by adding a semicolon, like this:</p>
<p>
  <pre> x = -y;

</pre>
But this expression could also appears in other contexts such as these. These are both a little strange, but they are legal C syntax. They help to illustrate the idea of an expression vs. the idea of a statement.</p>
<pre><p>if (<strong>x = -y</strong>)<br />
...</p><p>printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, <strong>x = -y</strong>);</p></pre>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The value is -4. Here's how that happens. We have an assignment, so we first evaluate the right hand side. The right hand side contains the unary operator minus, i.e. - (that is, an operator with only one operand). That is applied to the operand y, which results in the value -4 (we fetch the value of y, namely 4, out of memory and then apply the - sign to negate the value.). <br />
    <br />
  Then, the expression x = -4 is evaluated. The assignment operator = is treated as a binary operator with left operand x, and right operand -4 (the result of applying the unary operator - to the value of y). The = operator results in the left operand being assigned the value of the right operand, and then returns the value assigned as the result of the expression. So the value is -4</li>
  <li>The type is int</li>
  <li>There is one binary operator, namely =</li>
  <li>There is one unary operator, namely -</li>
  <li>The unary operator is -, and its operand is y</li>
  <li>The binary operator is =, and its operands  are x (left operand), and the result of -y (right operand)</li>
</ol>
<p>With those examples, you should be able to complete homework H04.</p>
