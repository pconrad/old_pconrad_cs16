<p>For this homework, the preparation is the material presented in lecture on 01/21, and the summary of that material on the following handout<br />
    <a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/cs16/10W/homework/H07/handout">http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/cs16/10W/homework/H07/handout</a><br />

<p>Once you've read that handout, write answers to the questions on this sheet  (use the <a href="H07.pdf">PDF link</a> to print a copy of this if you weren't in class).</p>

<ol>
  <li>Suppose you are running a main C program with the following first line:<br />
    <strong>int main(int argc, char *argv[])<br />
    </strong><br />
    and that the command line typed to run this program is: ./foo bar fum fiddle<br />
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>(3 pts) What is the value of argc?<br />
          <br />
      </li>
      <li>(3 pts) What is the value of argv[0]?<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>(3 pts) What is the value of argv[1]?<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>(3 pts) What is the value of argv[2][2]?<br />
      <br />
        <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:larger;">Please turn over for questions to answer</span><br />

  <li>There is a function you can use to convert the 4.5 from the form it has when it is a command line argument into a form that can be stored in an <strong>double</strong> variable. <br />
