<hr />
<p>You've been through one pair programming experience already, as well as having done some individual programming earlier in the quarter. So, now, rather than just give me back the answers from the video or reading online, you can share from your own experience.<br />
  <br />
Complete this together—the whole idea of this exercise is to get you and your new pair partner talking about the pair programming process, to try to get you started on the right foot.</p>
<ol>
  <li>(6 pts) Write down two things <em>you personally</em> would value in an <em>ideal</em> pair partner.<br />
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li> These could be qualities your previous partner had that you liked.</li>
      <li>Or it could be qualities that you wish he/she had (but didn't).</li>
      <li>To avoid any hurt feelings, I'd suggest that you be a little discreet about sharing which of those is the case. :-)</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    (i)<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    (ii)<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
  
  </li>
  <li>(6 pts) Write down two things <em>you personally</em> would prefer to <em>avoid</em> in an <em>ideal</em> pair partner.<br />
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li> These could be qualities your previous partner had that you didn't care for.</li>
        <li>Or it could be qualities that you are really glad he/she didn't have!</li>
        <li>Again, &quot;discretion is the better part of valor&quot;—in other words, &quot;be nice&quot;—but also be honest and clear. <br />
          <br />
        This is your chance for a fresh start, so express what you are looking for and what you hoping to avoid, especially if this is someone you are just getting to know.<br />
        <br />
    (i)<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    (ii)<br />
    <br />
    
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:larger;">Please turn over for more problems</span></p>
      <p style="page-break-before:always"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:larger;">Continued from other side</span><br />
      </p>
    <br />
  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<li>(6 pts) List at least <strong>two times</strong> that you and your pair programming partner(s) can get together between now and next week's lab session, for at least 1-2 hours each time.<br />
      <br />
  Preferably, this time should be during the times that CSIL is open. <span>(CSIL is open from 8:30am every day of the week, until 1:30am Sunday thru Thursday, and until 11:30pm Friday and Saturday.)</span><br />
  <br />
If meeting at CSIL is not convenient, be sure that at least one of you has a laptop that is set up to access CSIL via SSH, that has good wireless access, and that you have a place you can work together with a good wireless connection.<br />
<br />
  NOTE: If you cannot find any such times, you may need to switch partners—if so talk to your TA. But before you do that, I want to encourage you to really try hard to find two such times.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  </li>
  <li>(20 pts) <strong>Log on to Gauchospace, and find the forum called &quot;lab05 pair partners&quot;. Make a post to this forum</strong> (one per pair or trio), following the instructions given on that forum. (You'll need your answers from the previous written question).<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>(0 pts—optional, but encouraged)</strong> Find out something about your pair partner <em>that has nothing to do with computers. </em>This doesn't need to be—and probably shouldn't be—something deeply private or personal. It could just be an activity she/he enjoys, a kind of music he/she likes, a place she/he enjoys visiting, something that is important to him/her in their life, etc.<br />
      <br />
  (optional) Write down that one thing about each of your pair partners here.<br />
    <br />
    Here's why: 
    writing it down will help you remember it. It will also help the TAs and instructors get to know each of the students in the class better.<br />
