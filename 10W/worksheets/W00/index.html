   For this assignment, it is only <em>necessary</em> to turn in one submission per pair (or trio) is needed—that is permitted.<br />
  It is <em>permitted</em>, and <em>safer</em> if each of you hands in your own copy.<br />

  <li>(6 pts) Describe the main idea of pair programming, including the roles of &quot;driver&quot; and &quot;navigator&quot;.<br />

  </li>
<li>(6 pts) List at least <strong>two times</strong> that you and your pair programming partner(s) can get together between now and next week's lab session, for at least 1-2 hours each time.<br />
      <br />
  Preferably, this time should be during the times that CSIL is open. <span>(CSIL is open from 8:30am every day of the week, until 1:30am Sunday thru Thurday, and until 11:30pm Friday and Saturday.)</span><br />
  <br />
If meeting at CSIL is not convenient, be sure that at least one of you has a laptop that is set up to access CSIL via SSH, that has good wireless access, and that you have a place you can work together with a good wireless connection.<br />
<br />
  NOTE: If you cannot find any such times, you may need to switch partners—if so talk to your TA. But before you do that, I want to encourage you to reallly try hard to find two such times.<br />
