  <h3>Practice Exams from previous quarters</h3>
  <p><strong>Important Note: </strong>  these practice exams come from Fall quarter, when the exam was at a slightly different point in the course—so the topics may not exactly line up with what is covered on the exam this quarter. They are accurate as a guide to what &quot;kinds&quot; of questions you can expect, but the exact detail of topics covered may be different.<br />
  <br /> 
  For example, number conversions will NOT appear on the first midterm in Winter 2010—those will appear on the 2nd midterm, and the final exam.</p>
