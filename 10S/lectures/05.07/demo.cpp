// demo.cpp  A first program in C++



// We are going to stick with C style I/O (printf/scanf)
// for the time being... later we'll learn cin/cout 
//  or maybe you'll learn that in CS24
// Normally in C++ you'd use #include <iostream> with no .h

#include <stdio.h> // normally you would not see this in C++

int main()
{
  printf("Hello World\n");
  return 0;  
}
