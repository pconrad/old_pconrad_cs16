printf vs. return in functions...

  as Joe Biden would say, this is a BFD


If you want to be sure to get as much help as possible
from the compiler---i.e. have it tell you about warnings:

do this before you make your program:

 export CFLAGS="-Wall"

That means "warnings?  give me all of them!"

watch for 5 / 9   or 9 /5 e.g. in fToC calculations....
