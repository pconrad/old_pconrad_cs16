(0)  Announcements:   crashers done!

  AFAIK, everyone who wanted an add code and stuck around to do the
  homeworks got an add code.  (It was close though).

(1) Quick tricks:

Exponents:

   2^3 and 3^2 don't do what you expect in C.  (they are bitwise-xor)
  
   Use pow(2,3) or pow(3,2) instead, or just x*x  or x*x*x

   Note that pow() returns a double, and requires #include <math.h>
   as well as:
      export CFLAGS="-lm"
   Before you make a program that does #include <math.h>

The annoying make completion thingy:

  To get completion to work with make (for now):

     complete -r make
   
(2) firstCProgram.c

what happens when you enter y

(3) review of printNXs and printNXsCmd

Note what happens when you type printNXsCmd without anything on the
command line.

See how annoying this is...   the whole "segmentation fault" thing.

A future lab will cover how to debug seg faults.

(4) Talk about how to use

 void printNXs(int n);

to implement:

 void printXBox(int width, int height;)


(5) Compare that with the alternative---a nested loop

  Talk about how with nested loops you need different variables, i, j

  Show what happens if you don't do that...


(6) How would you make 

void triangleBox(int n);

where for n=5 the output is:

x
xx
xxx
xxxx
xxxxx

where for n=3 the output is?

x
xx
xxx

How about the "love and kisses function":

void loveAndKisses(int n);

n=5:

xoxox

n=6:

xoxoxo
