          </ul>
      </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>This should not be your first programming course!<br />
</h2>
<p>You should already have had a course where you learned the following, perhaps in Python, Java, Visual Basic, C, C++, C# or some other programming language.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>If</strong> you took CS8 and got a C-, D+, D, D- or F:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>then</strong>: CS16 may not be a good choice for you—please repeat CS8 first.</li>
  </ul>
<p>You should be comfortable with at least the following.</p>
<ul><li>variables, expressions. assignment statements (e.g. <code>x = x + 1</code> makes x one more than it used to be)</li>
  <li>order of operations (operator precedence), e.g.<code> 2 + 4 * 5 </code>gives  22, not 40</li>
  <li>if/else, such as: 
    <pre>if (x&lt;0)<br />  printf(&quot;Negative);<br />else<br />  printf(&quot;Positive);
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>loops (while loops, for loops)—for example, if <code>x</code> starts at 16, what value will <code>count</code> be when this loop is finished—when we reach the line <code>return count; </code>?
    <pre>count = 0;<br />while (x&gt;1)
{<br />  x = x / 2;<br />  count = count + 1;<br />}<br />return count;</pre>
  </li>
  <li>functions (function definition, function call, arguments, parameters)    </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Why do we use functions in a program—what is the problem that they solve?</li>
    <li>(<strong>If you studied  Java</strong>: you may be familiar with the word <em>method</em> rather than <em>function</em>. For purposes of this discussion—if you know what a method is, then you know what a function is. The difference between method and function comes up in later courses (CS24, CS32), but isn't important for CS16.)</li>
    </ul>
  <li>arrays
    <ul>
      <li>If you studied Python, you may know these as lists</li>
      <li>a[0], a[1]. a[2], etc...</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
<h3>Since this is not a first programming course, we'll move quickly</h3>
<ul>
  <li>We <strong>don't </strong>expect you to already know <strong>C</strong></li>
  <li>But we <strong>do</strong> expect you to already know <strong>how to program</strong></li>
  <li>So, we'll be:
    <ul>
      <li>moving through chapters in the book quickly</li>
      <li>sometimes introducing a few details of C earlier than they appear in the book</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The purpose is to give you a chance to <strong>solve interesting problems</strong> earlier.</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Three topics we want to introduce early:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>arrays</li>
  <li>structs</li>
  <li>functions</li>
  </ul>
<p>In C, there are a lot of <em>details</em> associated with arrays, structs, and functions—so many details that many authors delay their introduction.</p>
<p>We want to try a different approach: </p>
<ul>
  <li>a very basic way to deal with arrays, structs and functions early</li>
  <li>a more detailed way to deal with arrays, structs and functions later on.</li>
  </ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Three pieces of software—all on CSIL</h2>
<p>All of our work with C programming will be done on the CSIL computers.</p>
<ul>
  <li>CSIL: Computer Science Instructional Lab—a collection of computers running Linux</li>
  <li>The three pieces of software we'll use:
    <ul>
      <li><code>ch</code>: for typing in short fragments of C code to see what they do</li>
      <li><code>emacs</code>: for typing in complete C programs </li>
      <li><code>make</code>: for compiling complete C programs (so we can run them)</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We'll start today's lecture with a brief demonstration of each of those.</li>
</ul>
<div class="sideNoteDiv">
  <h3>Frequently asked questions—look over these later...</h3>
  <p>	Q: Can I work from my own computer (running Windows, Mac OS, or Linux?)<br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Yes—as long as it is connected to the internet
    <ul>
      <li>You'll use an internet connection to set up a &quot;terminal session on CSIL&quot; from your own computer</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>On PCs, you need to download one piece of software: PuTTY
    <ul>
      <li>There is also an optional piece of software called XMing that can be helpful too, but it isn't necessary</li>
      <li>Details are available at this link: <a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/topics/CSILviaPutty/">http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/topics/CSILviaPutty/</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>On Mac and Linux, you can use the ssh command, which is likely already installed.
    <ul>
      <li>Details available here: <a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/topics/CSILFromMacOrLinux/">http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/topics/CSILFromMacOrLinux/</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p>Q: Do I need to download _____ on to my machine? (where ___ is <code>emacs</code>, <code>make</code>, <code>ch</code>, etc.)</p>
<ul>
  <li>No—you do <strong>not</strong> need to download emacs, make or ch, for your machine.
    <ul class="spaciousList">
      <li><strong>if you are on Windows, you only need to download <a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/topics/CSILviaPutty/">PuTTY</a> </strong>(and optionally, XMing)</li>
      <li><strong>If you are on Mac/Linux, you probably <a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/topics/CSILFromMacOrLinux/">don't need to download anything</a></strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p>	Q: What if I want to work offline—i.e. while disconnected from the Internet?</p>
<ul>
  <li>While it is <em>possible</em> to download versions of emacs, make, ch, for  various systems so that you can work offline,  <em>we don't recommend it—</em>and as a result, we suggest that if you want to go this route, you are &quot;on your own&quot;.<br />
    <br />
    There are various reasons including the fact that (a)&nbsp;many of the assignments involve working in pairs, or specific other resources that are available on CSIL, e.g. scripts that check your work, creating files on the web, etc. (b)&nbsp;individual computers and versions of the operating systems on them vary so widely that we've found that trying to help students with installation of software on their individual machines is a major &quot;time-sink&quot; for instructors and TAs---consuming time that could be better spent on helping you learn the problem solving and C language topics that are the focus of the course.<br />
  </li>
</ul>
</div> <!-- side note div -->

<h2>Basics of using Ch</h2>
<p>There is a very useful program on CSIL called Ch that you can use to learn about some of the basic properties of the C programming language.</p>
<p>Ch is an 'interpreter' for C&mdash;it allows you to type in C statements one at a time, and have those statements be immediately turned into something that can be executed by the computer, one at a time. This is really helpful for trying out small bits of code to see what they will do. </p>
<p>Ch has many other uses, as we may see later in the course&mdash;but for today we'll primarily be using it for little experiments to learn about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>declaring variables</li>
  <li>assignments statements</li>
  <li>the printf command.</li>
</ul>
<p>To bring up Ch on CSIL, login in, then simply type <strong>ch</strong> at the command prompt.</p>
<p>You should see something like this (except the directory will be different) </p>
<pre>-bash-3.2$ <strong>ch</strong><br />
                                   Ch 
                Professional edition, version 6.1.0.13751

                     http://www.softintegration.com

/cs/faculty/pconrad&gt; </pre>
<p>The /cs/faculty/pconrad that appears in the  prompt is an indication of what directory you are in—for you it, may be something such as: </p>
<p><code>/cs/student/bettywhite&gt; </code></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><code>/cs/guest/avigoda&gt; </code></p>
<h4>Customizing the Ch prompt</h4>
<p>When working in Ch, I typically change the prompt to be the letters <code>Ch&gt;</code> and I invite my students to do the same. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Changing the prompt like this helps to remind us that we are working in Ch</li>
  <li>If we both do it, then the examples of Ch sessions I provide to you will look the same as what you see on your screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's how:  while in Ch, type the following command:<strong><code> _prompt = &quot;Ch&gt; &quot;</code></strong><br />
</p>
<p>Here's what doing that may look like:</p>
<pre>/cs/faculty/pconrad&gt; <strong>_prompt = &quot;Ch&gt; &quot;</strong>
Ch&gt;</pre>
<p>Note  the following important details:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the underscore _ at the beginning of <code>_prompt</code></li>
  <li>the space after the &gt; and before the &quot; inside <code>&quot;Ch&gt; &quot;</code></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Now, your prompt is <code>Ch&gt; </code>(with a space after it).</p>
<h3>Getting out of Ch</h3>
<p>To get out of Ch and get back to the <code>-bash-3.2$</code> prompt, just type <code>exit</code> like this:</p>
<p><code>Ch&gt; <strong>exit</strong><br />
  -bash-3.2$ </code></p>
<p>Now, let's get back into Ch, and explore declaring variables in C:</p>
<p>
  <pre>-bash-3.2$ <strong>ch</strong><br />                                   Ch <br />                Professional edition, version 6.1.0.13751 <br />              (C) Copyright 2001-2009 SoftIntegration, Inc.<br />                     http://www.softintegration.com<br />/cs/faculty/pconrad&gt; <strong>_prompt = &quot;Ch&gt; &quot;</strong><br />Ch&gt;  <br />
  </pre>
  <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
 <div class="importantDiv"><p>We actually did a bit more Ch in the real lecture—we also showed a few arithmetic expressions, and order of operations, and printf—that isn't captured in these notes.<br />
   <br />
 We'll do a bit more with Ch on Wednesday.</p>
 </div>
  <p><strong>Next up: working with an entire C program</strong>: emacs and make</p>
  <h2>Backgroud about text editors:<br />
    &quot;Why you should 
  <em>emacs</em> (or vi, but not pico or nano)&quot;</h2>
  <p>Typing in code to ch one line at a time is great for learning some of the basics of C and getting immediate feedback—but when we work with longer programs, we need a way to save them in a file.</p>
  <p>A program that will allow us to create and modify files on the disk is called an editor.</p>
  <p>The editor we'll concentrate on in this course and recommend to you is: emacs</p>
  <ul>
    <li>emacs is what we recommend if you don't already know an editor
      <ul>
        <li>It offers a balance between being powerful, and being easy to learn.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>vi or vim is also a good choice
      <ul>
        <li>But only if you already know it—in my experience, it is harder for beginners to learn.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>You are free to use any editor you like, but we recommend against pico or nano—more below.</li>
    <li>We also recommend against transferring files to your PC and using Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac)
      <ul>
        <li>You need to learn an editor on CSIL so that you can be effective team member </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Text editors vs. IDEs</h3>
  <p>You may have worked with a &quot;integrated development environment (IDE)&quot;  before such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>IDLE for Python</li>
    <li>Visual Studio for .net, Visual Basic, Visual C++, C#, etc.</li>
    <li>BlueJ, Netbeans or Eclipse for Java</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Those environments are very useful tools—and in a later course (CS32) you'l work with one called Netbeans that has great features for working with large projects in C++ and Java.</p>
  <p>However, it is also very handy to know how to use a plain text editor—and CS16, that's the environment we'll emphasize:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Knowing how to work with programs in a plain-text editor is a basic skill that many employers will expect you to have.</li>
    <li>It is very useful in a wide variety of real-world situations—e.g. when the fancy tools are not working properly, and you simplify and  get down to what is &quot;under the hood&quot;</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>emacs vs. vi—a &quot;religious&quot; war?</h3>
  <p>There are two  &quot;plain editors&quot; that are widely used in the software development world: emacs and vi</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Note that each comes in flavors: emacs may be also be xemacs, vi may also be vim</li>
    <li>The folklore among software developers is that there is a sort of &quot;religious war&quot; between vi and emacs
      <ul>
        <li>See for example, this cartoon: <a href="http://xkcd.com/378/">http://xkcd.com/378/</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>A few of the differences
      <ul>
        <li>vi tends to be smaller, requires less disk space and memory, and load faster</li>
        <li>emacs tends to be easier for beginners to learn—vi modes can be frustrating for beginners</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Both offer:
      <ul>
        <li>syntax highlighting, special features for programmer productivity (multple buffers), an empahsis on code</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Why nano and pico are discouraged
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pico_(text_editor)">pico</a> was originally designed for editing text (as part of the pine email system) and lacks features needed for programmer productivity</li>
        <li>nano does incorporate some of those features, but not enough for us to recommend it</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once you learn an editor, it is difficult to retrain your fingers for another one—so choose a good one.</p>
  <h2>Emacs basics</h2>
  <p>About the control characters:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> C-x is read as &quot;control C&quot; and it means: <em>hold down control, and type  x</em></li>
    <li>C-x C-c means &quot;control X control C&quot; and it means: <em>hold down control, and type x then type c</em></li>
    <li>etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <table border="2" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1">
    <tr >
      <th width="48%" scope="col">To do this</th>
      <th width="48%" scope="col">Here's what you type:</th>
    </tr>
    <tr >
      <td>Start emacs from the bash command line<br />
      to create or modify the file <code>hello.c</code></td>
      <td>At the bash prompt, type: <strong><code>emacs hello.c</code></strong>.<br />
      <br />
      If hello.c doesn't already exist, you'll get an empty window to start typing.<br />
      <br />
      If it does already exist, the file will come up so you can make changes.</td>
    </tr>

      <td height="171">Leaving the editor (with or without saving changes)</td>
      <td><p><strong>C-x  C-c</strong><br />
          <br />
      If you have made changes, you'll be asked to save:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>type <strong>y</strong> to save changes</li>
          <li>type <strong>n</strong> to leave without saving changes (see note*)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr >

    </tr>
    <tr >
      <td>Saving the file without leaving emacs</td>
      <td><strong>C-x</strong> <strong>C-s</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>*Note: If you are asked if you want to save changes and you hit  n for &quot;no&quot;, as a safety measure emacs will ask:<br />
    <code>Modified buffers exist; exit anyway? (yes or no)</code><br />
    <br />
In this case you must spell out the word <strong>yes</strong> to indicate that you don't want the changes saved.</p>
