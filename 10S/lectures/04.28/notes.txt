Today's lecture continues the discussion from 04.26 about the function to
count spaces in a string.

We'll look to two other functions...

* find the index of the first space
* sum an array of integers.

If there is time left, we may look at a few others ways
to count spaces or sum an array... 

* Using pointers/dereferencing instead of array subscripting
* Alternatives to loops

except for one thing: it trips people up so often!

It isn't really all that useful, but they stuck
it in the language anyway.

Here's where it is used----(see comma.c)
