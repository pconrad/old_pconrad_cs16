04/14---we went over some code from the midterm exam E01 from
Winter quarter...

We talked about the difference between return and printf
in a simple function

We also talked about   the meaning of 2^3   3^2 
which is NOT exponent, but rather "bitwise exclusive or"

Bitwise exclusive or will not be on midterm E01, but it
will be on the following one---not because it is that
important for you to know, per se, but because:

(1) It is good practice with binary

(2) It is helpful in knowing that x^y does NOT mean exponent in C.
