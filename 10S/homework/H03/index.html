<p>For this assignment, you need the <strong>official textbook for this course by Delores Etter.</strong></p>
<p>If you haven't purchased it yet, please do so as soon as possible. <br />
  <br />
For the time being, you use a <strong>copy on 2-hour loan under course reserve at the UCSB Davidson Library</strong>.<br />
Here's the information you need to get it. (Note that the library uses COMP016instead of CMPSC16 or CS16—I have no idea why.)  </p>
