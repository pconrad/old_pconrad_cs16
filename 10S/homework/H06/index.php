<p>In addition to reading Etter 2.3 again, please also review the following handout  that was distributed in lecture, and is also available online at this link: <a href="handout">http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/cs16/10S/homework/H06/handout</a><br />
</p>
<p>Once you've read that handout, write answers to the questions on this sheet  (use the <a href="H06.pdf">PDF link</a> to print a copy of this if you weren't in class).</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Question: </strong>Given the expression 3 + 4 * 5<br />
      <br />
    Note that you don't have to give as detailed an explanation as on the handoutâ€”those detailed explanations were to help you understand where the answers came from. All that you need to provide below is the actual answer to the question.</p>
