 <h1>Troubleshooting for Lab00</h1>
 <hr>

 <h2>Follow these instructions to solve problems with Lab00</h2>

 <a name="step0">
 <h3>If trouble with Step 0: Creating College of Engineering Account</h3>
  <p>If you try to create a College of Engineering account, and it doesn't work, then send email
  to support@cs.ucsb.edu. In your email, </p>
  <ul>
   <li>cc your instructor and your TA on the email.</li>
   <li>Indicate that you are enrolled in CS16 </li>
   <li>Indicate that you tried the form at
    <a href="https://accounts.engr.ucsb.edu/create/">https://accounts.engr.ucsb.edu/create/</a>
    and it didn't work.</li>
   <li>Provide your full name, perm number and your UCSB &quot;umail&quot; email address. </li>
   <li>Tell them approximately when you enrolled in the class on GOLD&mdash;not the exact day/time,
   just whether it was &quot;weeks ago&quot;, &quot;a few days ago&quot;, &quot;yesterday&quot;,
   &quot;this morning&quot; or &quot;about an hour ago&quot; is all they need to know. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note that <em>if you are not enrolled in the course on GOLD</em>, you normally cannot get
  a College of Engineering account&mdash;if there is some problem with your GOLD registration,
  but you still need to start the work in the course speak with your instructor about this.</p>
  </ul>

 <a name="step2">
 <h3>If trouble with Step 2: Logging on</h3>
 <p>If your username/password don't work</p>
  <ul>
   <li>If you just created your College of Engineering account, wait 15-20 minutes and try again.</li>
   <li>If you created your College of Engineering account more than 15-20 minutes ago, then:
     <ul>
       <li>cc your instructor and your TA on the email.</li>
       <li>Indicate that you are enrolled in CS16 </li>
       <li>Indicate that created an account at
       <a href="https://accounts.engr.ucsb.edu/create/">https://accounts.engr.ucsb.edu/create/</a>
       but you were not able to log in</li>
       <li>Indicate whether you were trying to login in Cooper, or in CSIL at the time you had the
       problem</li>
       <li>Provide your full name, perm number, UCSB &quot;umail&quot; email address, and the username
       you were trying to use.</li>
       <li>Tell them approximately when you enrolled in the class on GOLD&mdash;not the exact day/time,
       just whether it was &quot;weeks ago&quot;,&quot;a few days ago&quot;, &quot;yesterday&quot;,
       &quot;this morning&quot; or &quot;about an hour ago&quot; is all they need to know. </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
 <p>Note: DO NOT include your password in your email to support. In fact, NEVER send your password
   through email, and NEVER tell anyone else your password, not even the support staff. Real support
   staff will NEVER ASK YOU FOR YOUR PASSWORD&mdash;not over email, and not in person. They won't need
   it to help you.</p>
 <p>If someone is asking for your password over email, it is a scam called a
   &quot;phishing attack&quot;&mdash;don't be fooled by these dastardly villains.</p>
