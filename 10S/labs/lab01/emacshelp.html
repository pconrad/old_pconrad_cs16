 <h1>Emacs Help<br>For CS16 Lab01</h1>
 <hr>
 <h2>Starting emacs</h2>
 <p>To bring up emacs to make changes to ctof.c, type:</p>
 <pre><strong>emacs ctof.c</strong></pre>
 <p>This may bring up a new window where you can edit this program.</p>
 <h3>Do I have to use emacs?</h3>
 <p>If there is another program  that you prefer, e.g. vim, that is already available on the
    Cooper Lab (and CSIL) computers, and you already know how to use it (or are willing to take
    responsibility for learning how) that's fine. So, no, you don't <em>have</em> to use emacs,
    specifically. However you will need to learn some editor that works on the lab computers.
    Working only on your own PC or Mac at home will not be sufficient.</p>
 <p>By the way, knowing how to use either vi/vim or emacs is really a kind of a
    &quot;basic skill&quot; that every software developer should have in his/her toolkit.
    So if you don't already know one of those editors, now is as good a time as any to start
    learning one of them.</p>
 <h2>Some emacs commands</h2>
 <p>Here are a few emacs commands that may be helpful to know. </p>
 <p>Remember that:</p>
 <p>C-x is called &quot;control-X&quot; and means &quot;hold down the <strong>control</strong>
   or <strong>Ctrl</strong> key while typing the letter x&quot;<br> 
   C-x 1 means &quot;type control-X, then type the number 1&quot;.<br>
   C-x C-c means &quot;type control-X then type control-C&quot;.</p>
 <table border="2">
   <tr>
     <th scope="col">Keystroke</th>
     <th scope="col">Command</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>C-x 1</td>
     <td>If there are multiple windows, get rid of the other ones.<br>
      I only want the one the cursor is in right now.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Arrow Keys</td>
     <td>Used to move around</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Delete/Backspace</td>
     <td>Deletes the previous character</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>C-d</td>
     <td>Deletes the character immediately under the cursor</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>C-x C-w</td>
     <td>Save As</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>C-x C-s</td>
     <td>Save</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>C-x C-c</td>
     <td>Exit emacs (it will ask if you want to save)</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>C-g</td>
     <td>Cancel current command (&quot;<strong>g</strong>et me out of trouble&quot;)</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>C-k</td>
     <td>Kill (delete) the current line</td>
   </tr>
 </table>
 <h3>An emacs reference</h3>
 <p>Here's a link to a <a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/emacs/refcard.pdf">PDF
    File with lots more emacs commands</a>&mdash;it is suitable for printing on a single
    sheet of paper (front and back) and having handy while you work in emacs.</p>
