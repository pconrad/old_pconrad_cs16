<strong>Revised Schedule</strong></h1>

</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because this is an intermediate course, and the textbook is designed for an &quot;introductory course&quot; (where students have no prior exposure to programming), we will introduce some concepts in lecture at a &quot;basic level&quot; earlier than the full detailed treatment in the textbook. Therefore,  participation at every lecture is crucial to your success.</p>
<p>The following schedule has been revised from the one on the original syllabus to more accurately reflect the actual coverage of topics in the course.</p>

<h2 class="pageBreakBefore"><strong>A special note about collaboration</strong></h2>
<p>As mentioned above, one of the things we really want to convey in this course is that real-world software development is very seldom an 'individual sport'—is it much more often a 'team sport'. Companies want to hire CS and CE graduates that know how to collaborate with others on producing software.</p>
<p>In the CS Department at UCSB, we understand the value of this. However, it puts us in a tricky position. </p>
<p>On the one hand, we want to encourage working together in ways that help you develop your skills and teamwork, and help you understand that programming can be a social, collaborative, creative activity—not something done only by loner nerds in cubicles. The sooner you start with activities such as pair programming, code reviews, and other collaborative software development activities, the more skill you'll develop, and the sooner you'll be ready for the real world. Plus, for many people, working together with others is a lot more enjoyable and fun than being a loner.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we need to avoid any situations where freeloaders are &quot;coasting&quot; through courses by leaning too much on others—never developing independent skills as programmers. This situation creates huge problems. Mostly it is damaging to the freeloaders themselves, who eventually crash and burn, perhaps far too late to choose another career path without significant difficulty. However, it also creates problems for everyone else—some hardworking students become demoralized by the unfairness of it all, and the value of a UCSB education is diminished by the  freeloaders' lack of accomplishment.</p>
<p>Thus, we must strike a balance. </p>
<p>Our emphasis on collaboration means:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We will try to create opportunities for you to work in pairs on assignments—in some cases, we may even require it.</li>
  <li>We will try to create opportunities for you to develop skills at talking about and reflecting on your own code and other people's code in small groups (code reviews).</li>
  <li>Some in-class assignments will permit discussion with other students.</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn't not mean, however: </p>
<ul><li>That you can &quot;just copy&quot; homework or code from others and claim it as your own work.</li>
  <li>That you can work together on assignments where you've been specifically told not to.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bottom line:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We'll try to be very specific about what kinds of collaboration are permitted, and what kinds of collaboration are not permitted, and are considered academic dishonesty.</li>
  <li>If you are not sure about whether some kind of collaboration is permitted or not, it is your responsibility to<strong> ask questions.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A final note:  the emphasis on collaboration in this course does not necessarily extend to other CS courses you make take in the future.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each course will have its own policies, and the default policy is still: <strong>no collaboration.</strong></li>
  <li>Please be sure you understand each instructors policy on collaboration carefully, and don't assume it will be the same as that from previous courses.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="pageBreakBefore closeOnBottom">Grading</h2>

<p class="closeOnTop">To determine your final letter grade, I will calculate two numbers:</p>
<table border="2">
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">Weighted course average<br /></th>
    <td>40% <span class="style2">Assignments/Quizzes/Homework/Projects</span><br /> 
      + 60%  Exams <br />
      (2 midterms and final, 20% each)</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">Weighted exam average</th>
    <td>Average score of two midterms and final (weighted equally)</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p class="closeOnBottom">I will then use the following table. This is a conventional 10 point scale with +, - with the lower three and upper three points of each range representing plus/minus. It also enforces a policy that your final course grade can be no more than one letter grade higher than your exam average.</p>

<p><strong>Curving: </strong>The grade  scale above represents the <em>minimum</em> letter grade you will be assigned&#8212;at the instructor's discretion, the grading scale  may be altered <em>in the students' favor</em> if this will be better reflect the students' mastery of the material. Thus, <em>if</em> there is a &quot;curve&quot;, it will be applied at the <em>end</em>, not to individual assignments.</p>
<p><strong>A+ grades: </strong>These may be awarded to the very best performing students in the class—but the cutoff for A+ grades will be determined at the end of the course at the discretion of the instructor (there is no pre-determined cutoff---an average of 97 or more doesn't guarantee you an A+ grade.)</p>
<h2><strong>Academic Honesty</strong></h2>
<p>You should read and understand the UCSB policy on academic honesty listed below. You should also understand that I take academic honesty and personal integrity very seriously, and will do my best to uphold and enforce this UCSB policy. (Also see the section on collaboration, earlier in this syllabus.)</p>
<blockquote class="finePrint">It is expected that students attending the University of California understand and subscribe to the ideal of academic integrity, and are willing to bear individual responsibility for their work. Any work (written or otherwise) submitted to fulfill an academic requirement must represent a student’s original work. Any act of academic dishonesty, such as cheating or plagiarism, will subject a person to University disciplinary action. Using or attempting to use materials, information, study aids, or commercial “research” services not authorized by the instructor of the course constitutes cheating. Representing the words, ideas, or concepts of another person without appropriate attribution is plagiarism. Whenever another person’s written work is utilized, whether it be a single phrase or longer, quotation marks must be used and sources cited. Paraphrasing another’s work, i.e., borrowing the ideas or concepts and putting them into one’s “own” words, must also be acknowledged. Although a person’s state of mind and intention will be considered in determining the University response to an act of academic dishonesty, this in no way lessens the responsibility of the student.<br />
    <br />
    <em> (Section A.2 from: <a href="http://www.sa.ucsb.edu/regulations"><strong>http://www.sa.ucsb.edu/regulations</strong></a>,  Student Conduct, General Standards of Conduct)</em></blockquote>
<h2 class="pageBreakBefore">Other Policies</h2>
<h3>Attendance</h3>
<p>This course moves quickly. So attendance is very important.</p>
<p>We'll be trying to master the material from about 14 chapters in the book, at about 2 chapters per week. We need to go at that pace, because we'll lose a couple of weeks to exams, and the last few lectures the quarter, you can't really start anything new, because there isn't time to put it into practice with programming assignments. If you don't put it into practice, you aren't very likely to learn it in any way that is going to stick with you, so there isn't much point in just &quot;going through the motions&quot;. </p>
<p>As a result, <strong>there will be something you have to turn in at almost every class</strong>. In this way, attendance is taken, and required.</p>
<p>These things you have to turn in will be a combination of in-class activities, and homework completed outside of class, but handed in on paper during class.</p>
<p>Quizzes may occur at anytime, announced or unannounced. Missed quizzes may not be made up, except per the &quot;personal day/sick day&quot; below—if you miss a quiz for any reason, and have already used your personal day/sick day, you will have to make up the points with extra credit.<br />
  <br />
Thus <strong>attendance is required</strong>, and <strong>reading the assigned readings is required.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Missing in-class activities.</strong></p>
<p>If you miss a class, you miss the opportunity for the points on that in-class assignment, or homework that was due. Period. </p>
<p>There is no makeup, except for </p>
<ul>
  <li>excused absences arranged and agreed to by the instructor <strong>in advance</strong>, for official UCSB activities</li>
  <li>one &quot;sick-day/personal day&quot; per student, per quarter (see below)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sick day/personal day</strong></p>
<p>To make up an assignment from a &quot;sick-day/personal-day&quot;, you must email me within 48 hours of the absence, to make an appointment to make up the assignment during the next scheduled office hours following your absence (or at an appointment time to be negotiated, if you have a conflict with those hours.) This make up must happen within one week of the absence, or 24 hours before the final exam, which ever is earlier.</p>
<p>In rare cases, if there is a documented family emergency, documented extended illness, documented required court appearance, or other situation beyond the students' control (with documentation) the instructor may grant additional make up days entirely at the instructor's discretion—but this is <strong>not</strong> a guarantee or a right.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Accommodations for disabilities</h2>
<p> Information about how UCSB supports students with disabilities is available at the campus ADA website: <a href="http://www.ada.ucsb.edu">http://www.ada.ucsb.edu. </a>If you require any special accommodations due to disabilities, please let me know as soon as possible. You may contact me by email to request an appointment: .</p>
