<h2>Worksheet Info</h2>

<p>The worksheets on this page were distributed in various lectures or labs.
</p>

<p>For worksheets, the expectation is that you attend 
the lecture or lab in which they were handed out, 
and hand them in at the end of that class.
</p>

     <p>In cases where the worksheet is graded, the same make up policies apply as for homework assignments.  You'll need to print out a copy of the worksheet, fill it out, and bring it to office hours in person.   To get credit, you have to use your "one personal day" (see the <a href="../homework">homework policies</a> for details.).</p>

  <p>Any exception to the above policies—for example if you have an &quot;special understanding&quot; with the instructor or TA about some discussion about an unavoidable personal circumstance—MUST be documented by an email trail, or such understanding will be considered null and void.</p>
