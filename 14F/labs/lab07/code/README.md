* Run "make tests" and see the five tests for initAirportFromStringTest pass.
* Add code for additional tests to initAirportFromStringTest.cpp, according to the instructions.   You need to follow the instructions closely to be sure that your code passes the tests on submit.cs later on.

* Edit airportFuncs.cpp and look for the function indexOfAirportWithSmallestLongitude.
* Read the function definition and understand how it works.
* Look at the function call in context in the file readAirports.cpp
* Run ./readAirports.cpp 5airports.csv and run ./readAirports airports.csv and see the output.
* Then, edit the stubs for the other three functions so that they also work properly:
** indexOfAirportWithLargestLongitude
** indexOfAirportWithSmallestLatitude
** indexOfAirportWithLargestLatitude
* Then, edit readAirports.cpp and add in the additional function calls to these three functions per the instructions.
* Run "make tests" and see the correct output.
* Try submitting to submit.cs to see if your output is correct.
