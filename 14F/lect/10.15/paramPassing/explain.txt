Write three programs.

One has a main where we read the command line arg, convert to int,
 then pass it to a function that returns the value, doubled.

 parameter type is int, return type is int.

Another has a function that doubles the value.
  
 parameter type is int &, return type is void.

Third one: parameter type is int *, return type is void.
  It has same effect as passing by reference, but uses pointers.
