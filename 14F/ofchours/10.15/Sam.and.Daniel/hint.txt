To filter out output without having to change your code,
try just using grep.

This runs the code and you see everything:

./lab02  

This runs the code, and you only see output lines that have the word "white"
in them:

./lab02 | grep white

etc.

Example:

bash-4.2$ ./lab02 | grep white
test.txt has -1 white space characters
Fox-In-Socks.txt has -1 white space characters
The-Fox.txt has -1 white space characters
bash-4.2$
