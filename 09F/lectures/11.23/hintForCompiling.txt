If you want to just use regular "make" to compile a simple
program, but you need -g, -lm or you want to use -Wall, 
you can use the command:

    export CFLAGS="whatever"

This will put extra flags on the compile command generated
by the "make" program.  For instance:

-bash-3.2$ export CFLAGS="-lm"
-bash-3.2$ make printList1
cc -lm    printList1.c   -o printList1
-bash-3.2$

-bash-3.2$ export CFLAGS="-lm -g"
-bash-3.2$ make printList1
cc -lm -g    printList1.c   -o printList1
-bash-3.2$

-bash-3.2$ export CFLAGS="-lm -Wall -g"
-bash-3.2$ make printList1
cc -lm -Wall -g    printList1.c   -o printList1
-bash-3.2$ 

You can reset this with 
   unset CFLAGS

-bash-3.2$ unset CFLAGS
-bash-3.2$ make printList1
cc     printList1.c   -o printList1
-bash-3.2$
