<h1>CS16, Wednesday 10/28/2009</h1>
<h2>Field day</h2>
<p> <img src="whereSmall.png" alt="Where to gather" width="223" height="226" style="float:right;" /></p>
<ol>
  <li>We'll start in the lecture hall, going over how arrays are passed to functions.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>We'll then quickly review the selection sort exercise.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>We'll then go over what we are going to do outside.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>We start outside by gathering in our small groups, in a circle around your group leader, in the location shown on the diagram.<br />
   <br />
  </li>
  <li>We'll go around quickly and say our name, and major, and what year we are.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Your leader will divide you into two equal size teams:<br />
  (Leaders: don't count offâ€”just indicate: team one starts &quot;here&quot;, and ends &quot;here&quot;)<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>There are squares on the sidewalk that represent the elements of an array, a[0], a[1], etc.<br />
    Everyone from Team 1 get into a square. Your group leader will hand you an array element.<br />
    Put the pink line after the last person in the array.<br />
    Team 2 gathers to watch.<br />
      <br />
  </li>
  <li>A volunteer from Team 2 will walk down the array and do the algorithm.<br />
    <ul>
      <li>Start with 0 for &quot;index of max so far&quot;, and i = 1.</li>
      <li>For each i from 1 to n-1
        <ul>
          <li>Stand beside a[i], facing team 2.</li>
          <li>Ask team 2, is a[i] larger than a[max index so far]?</li>
          <li>Team 2 shouts in unison &quot;YES&quot; or &quot;NO&quot;</li>
          <li>If they shout YES, change index of max so far to i</li>
          <li>Then, increment i, and move to the next array element.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>When all elements have been examined:
        <ul>
          <li>The person at  a[index of max so far] should swap index cards with the last person before the pink line</li>
          <li>Then move the pink line one person closer to a[0]</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>When you've done this n-1 times, the numbers should be sorted.<br />  
        <br />
          </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Let team 1 do this twice. Then swap places, and let Team 2 stand in to do the array exercise.</li>
  <li>Next, go back to sitting in a circle. But, find a pair partner to work with.
    <ul>
      <li>Those that have pair partners, start forming a circle</li>
      <li>Those without pair partners, stand in the center of the circle</li>
      <li>The TA will help those who don't have a partner get one</li>
      <li>If there is an "odd" number of students, we'll form exactly one group of three per lab</li>     
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Take one of the index cards with a number on it, and on the back, write the names of you and your pair partner.
    <ol>
      <li>When you give this to the TA, the TA will give you H06 and H07 to work on. </li>
      <li>Once that happens, if it isn't 1:50pm yet, or if you and your pair are both available, you are encourged to start working on H06 and H07.</li>
      <li>Either way, though, you are free to go at that point.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  </ol>
