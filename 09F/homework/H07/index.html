  About this assignment:</strong> In lecture on Monday 10/26 and Wednesday 10/28, we went over the main ideas of selection sort. Your job here is to begin to turn those ideas into C code.<br />
  <br />
For <em><strong>this</strong></em> assignment, it is not necessary that your code be perfect. We are grading you on whether you have made a good faith effort to try to write code that will work, and have prepared yourself for lab on Thursday/Friday.<br />
<br />
If you are confident in your solution, that's great. If you are lost, please come see your instructor or a TA for help. <br />
Conrad has office hours today 10/28, 4:15-5:15, and Harry has office hours 1-2pm on Thursday 10/29.<br />

  <li>(20 pts) First, write a function called indexOfMax that computes the index of the largest element in an array of ints.<br />
      <br />
    The function should take these parameters: an array (call it <code>a</code>) and  the size of the array (call it <code>n</code>, or <code>size</code>)<br />
    It should return the index of the largest value in the array (a number between <code>0</code> and <code>n-1</code>)<br />
      (In case of ties, return the index of <em>any one</em> of the values that is &quot;tied for largest&quot;.)<br />
    <br />

  </p>
  </li>
  <li>(20 pts) Write a function called selectionSort that sorts an array.<br />
    <br />
    The parameters to your function selectionSort will be the same as the parameters to indexOfMax.<br />
The function will be void—it operates by having a &quot;side effect&quot; on the array that is passed in (i.e. it sorts it.)<br />
<br />
Use the function that you defined in part one. You can use a function call like this one to find the location of the maximum value among all the first &quot;howMany&quot; elements of a.<br />
    <br />
    maxLoc = indexOfMax(a, howMany);<br />
    <br />
    With that tool, you should be able to write a function that performs selection sort by doing this repeatedly, on smaller and smaller parts of the array (all the elements, then the first n-1 elements, then the first n-2 elements, etc. until you are down to just 2 elements.) Each time, you want to swap the largest value with the element at the &quot;end&quot; of that part of the array.<br />
      <br />
    <br />
    Remember that to swap two values, you need code like this:<br />
      <br />
    temp = a[i];<br />
    a[i] = a[j];<br />
    a[j] = temp;<br />
      <br />
    <br />
