<p>Please obtain the official textbook for this course by Delores Etter. <strong>You will start having homework assignments in that book next week.</strong></p>
<p>For this week, the reading assignments are chapter 3 and 4 in an online textbook—Practical C Programming by Steve Oualline. Even though this book is a bit &quot;dated&quot;—as an example, find the sentence in Chapter 4 about how most PCs are 16 bit machines (!)—it is still a great resource for learning C, because many of the basics haven't changed.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In Chapter 3, the author discusses programming style.
      <ol>
      <li>(10 pts) According to the author, what are at least two &quot;real-world&quot; reasons that programming style is important?<br />
      (By &quot;real-world&quot; I mean reasons that will still be true after you graduate and are working in the so-called &quot;real world&quot;. For example, &quot;I need good style to get a good grade from my TA&quot; doesn't count as a real-world reason for purposes of this question.)<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      </li>
      <li>(5 pts) Section 3.4 presents two segments of code. The author indicates that the bottom one is better style, but doesn't explain why. So, I'm asking you: why is the bottom segment of code better style that the top one? <br />
        <br />
        For full credit, give me a thoughtful answer, not a simplistic one. A simplistic answer might be:  &quot;the bottom one has more space and comments&quot;. While that is technically correct, it doesn't really address the question in a thoughtful way—it doesn't explain <em><strong>why</strong></em> a segment of code with more space and comments is better style.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

  </li>
  <li>(3 pts) In Chapter 4, the author indicates the name of the funciton that is always called first in a C program. What is the name of that function?<br />
    <br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>(3 pts) In many C programs, there is a line of code at the end of main like this: <code>return 0;</code> <br />
      <br />
    According to the author, what is the purpose of that line of code?<br />
      <br />
      <br />
  </li>
  <li>Chapter 4 discusses variable declarations. Write variable declarations for each of the folloiwng. Include a comment after each declaration to indicate the purpose of the variable, just as you would do in a well written program:
    <br />
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>(4 pts) A integer variable called &quot;count&quot;. The comment should indicate that this counts the number of lines in the input file<br />
          <br />
          <br />
      </li>
      <li>(4 pts) A variable that can store a hospital patient's  temperature in Fahrenheit. You should be able to store numbers such as 98.6<br />
            <br />
          <br />
      </li>
      <li>(4 pts) A variable that can store the correct response on a multiple choice test, i.e. either a single letter, such as a, b, c, d or e. <br />
          <br />
        <br />
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Chapter 4 discusses the difference between floating point division and integer division. What would each of the following expressions evaluate to?<br />
      <br />
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>(2 pts) 4 / 2<br />
          <br />
          <br />
      </li>
      <li>(2 pts) 2 / 4<br />
            <br />
          <br />
      </li>
      <li>(2 pts) 4.0 / 2.0<br />
            <br />
          <br />
      </li>
      <li>(2 pts) 2.0 / 4.0<br />
            <br />
          <br />
      </li>
      <li>(2 pts) 1/2.0<br />
            <br />
          <br />
      </li>
      <li>(2 pts) 1.0/2<br />  
        <br />
