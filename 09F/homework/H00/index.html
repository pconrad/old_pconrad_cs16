<p><strong>About the homework in this course: <br />
  </strong><br />
  You will have homework for almost every lecture—or at least twice a week. This homework will usually involve first doing some reading in either  the main textbook for the course (authored by Etter), or one of the online textbooks available at the following links:<br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>On campus:  <a href="http://tr.im/safaribooks">http://tr.im/safaribooks</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Off campus: <a href="http://tr.im/ucsbsafari">http://tr.im/ucsbsafari</a> (Use your umail username/password)<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<p>For Monday, since I know from past experience that many of you will not yet have the textbook, I'm assigning two chapters of reading in an online textbook—Practical C Programming by Steve Oualline. Even though this book is a bit &quot;dated&quot;—as an example, find the sentence in Chapter 1 about how Java hasn't really caught on yet (!)—it is still a great resource for learning C, because those haven't changed much since 1997.</p>
<p>To link directly to this book, bring up this homework assignment online at this URL: <a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/cs16">http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/cs16</a>, then click on &quot;<a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/cs16/09F/homework">Homework</a>&quot;, then &quot;<a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/cs16/09F/homework/H00">H00</a>&quot;. Then you can use the links below to access the assigned chapters:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Chapter 1: What Is C? (<a href="http://search.safaribooksonline.com/1565923065/pcp3-PART-I">on campus</a>), (<a href="http://search.safaribooksonline.com.proxy.library.ucsb.edu:2048/1565923065/pcp3-PART-I">off campus</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note: we'll <strong>skip Chapter 2</strong>—this covers a lot of specifics of accessing C on systems that are very different from what we'll be using this quarter. If you want to read ahead to Chapters 3 and 4, though, be my guest—the homework for next Wednesday will cover part of that material.)</p>
<p>Once you've read these chapters, write answers to the questions on the reverse side of this sheet. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Ideally, you'll do this directly on the sheet that was handed out in lecture on Friday 09/25—this helps keep all the submissions organized for the TA, and makes it easier to grade.</li>
  <li>If you missed lecture on 09/25, you can bring up this assignment online (see the links above), and print out the PDF version (that will keep it to two sheets of paper.)</li>
</ul>

  <li>Chapter 1 starts with a discussion of some of the problems with writing programs in English rather than in a  programming language such as C that has strict rules about the meaning of statements. Two examples of the ambiguity of English are cited: one having to do with shampoo, and another having to do with California motorcycle helmet law.
    <br />
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>(5 pts) What was the problem with shampoo?<br />
        <br />
            <br />
            <br />
        <br />
          <br />
      </li>
      <li>(5 pts) What was the problem with the motorcycle helmet law?<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>(5 pts) Chapter 1 mentions the original purpose of FORTRAN, COBOL and Pascal, as well as the original purpose of the C programming language. <br />
      According to the author, C was designed with one purpose in mind: what was that purpose?<br />
      <br />
    <br />
    <br />
  <br />
  </li>
  <li>The author describes computer programs as having &quot;two main parts&quot;: data and instructions. He then goes on to give examples of C statements that are representative of each part.
    <br />
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>(5 pts) Write a C statement that is representative of &quot;data&quot;<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>(5 pts) Write a C statement that will eventually be turned into machine language instructions<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>(5 pts) In Chapter 1, the author mentions a way that, in C, we can group related data items together into a single unit. What is this unit called, and in the example code, what is the first on the line of C that allows this grouping?<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>(5 pts) From your previous study of programming (prior to taking CS16) you should already be generally familiar with constructs such as if/else,  while loops, and for loops that can change the order in which statements are executed. The author lumps all of those together under a general category of statement. What is the name the author users for this category of statement?<br />
    <br />
    <br />
