   For this assignment, it is only <em>necessary</em> to turn in one submission per pair (or trio) is needed—that is permitted.<br />
  It is <em>permitted</em>, and <em>safer</em> if each of you hands in your own copy.<br />
</strong></p>
<hr />
<p> Together with your pair partner, answer these questions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>(6 pts) You've been through one pair programming experience already, as well as having done some individual programming earlier in the quarter.<br />
      <br />
    So, now, rather than just give me back the answers from the video or reading online, you can share from your own experience.<br />
    <br />
    Complete this together—the whole idea of this exercise is to get you and your new pair partner talking about the pair programming process, to try to get you started on the right foot.<br />
      <br />
Write down two things <em>you personally</em> would value in an <em>ideal</em> pair partner.<br />
<br />
<ul>
      <li> These could be qualities your previous partner had that you liked.</li>
      <li>Or it could be qualities that you wish he/she had (but didn't).</li>
      <li>To avoid any hurt feelings, I'd suggest that you be a little discreet about sharing which of those is the case. :-)</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <br />
    (i)<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    (ii)<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    </li>
  <li>(6 pts) Along the same lines: write down two things <em>you personally</em> would prefer to <em>avoid</em> in an <em>ideal</em> pair partner.<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li> These could be qualities your previous partner had that you didn't care for.</li>
    <li>Or it could be qualities that you are really glad he/she didn't have!</li>
    <li>Again, &quot;discretion is the better part of valor&quot;—in other words, &quot;be nice&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<br />
    <br />
    (i)<br />
    <br />
    <br />
(ii)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
      <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:larger;">Please turn over for more problems</span></p>
      <p style="page-break-before:always"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:larger;">Continued from other side</span><br />
        <br />
  </p>
  </li>
<li>(10 pts) List at least <strong>three times</strong> that you and your pair programming partner(s) can get together between now and the time you are planning to leave for Thanksgiving break<strong>,</strong> for at least 1-2 hours each time.<br />
      <br />
  Preferably, you'll get together in CSIL (open 8:30am-2am Sun-Thursday, and 8:30am-midnight Friday and Saturday), but if not, be sure you can get together somewhere where you have access to a computer and a network connection.<br />
<br />
  NOTE: If you cannot find any such times, you may need to switch partners—if so talk to your TA. But before you do that, I want to encourage you to reallly try hard to find two such times.<br />

    <ul>
      <li>Put &quot;<strong>CS16 H09 09F</strong>&quot; in the subject line. 
        <ul>

      <li>Please put your FULL NAMES in the body of the email
        (e.g. Agnes Nitt, Jason Ogg)
        <ul>
          <li>We need to know who are you, so we can give you credit for the assignment</li>
          <li>Oddly enough, if all I have is an email address like <code>grr234ftw@aol.example.com</code>, I can't guess who you are!</li>
        </ul>
