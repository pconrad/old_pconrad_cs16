   For this assignment, it is only <em>necessary</em> to turn in one submission per pair (or trio) is needed—that is permitted.<br />
  It is <em>permitted</em>, and <em>safer</em> if each of you hands in your own copy.<br />

<p> If you want to see the pair programming video again, do a web search on "NC State Pair Programming Video"</p>
<ol>
  <li>(10 pts) Describe the main idea of pair programming, including the roles of &quot;driver&quot; and &quot;navigator&quot;.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    </li>
  <li>(12 pts) What are three important considerations to keep in mind in order to have a successful pair programming experience? <br />
    <br />

  </li>
<li>(10 pts) List at least <strong>two times</strong> that you and your pair programming partner(s) can get together between now and <span class="strikethrough">next Thursday at 11AM</span>, <span class="style5">your lab session on Thu 11/05 or Fri/06</span><strong>,</strong> for at least 1-2 hours each time.<br />
      <br />
  Preferably, this time should be during the times that CSIL is open.<span class="strikethrough">During Summer 2009, CSIL is open Monday-Friday from 8:30am to 5:30pm.</span> <span class="style5"><strong>(CSIL is open from 8:30am every day of the week, until 2am Sunday thru Thurday, and until midnight Friday and Saturday.)</strong></span><br />
  <br />
If you can't find a time to get together when CSIL is open (<strong></strong><span class="style5">but CSIL is almost always open except in the summer</span>) be sure that at least one of you has a laptop that is set up to <span class="strikethrough">work with Python and the cTurtle module,</span> access CSIL via SSH, that has good wireless access, and that you have a place you can work together with a good wireless connection.<br />
<br />
  NOTE: If you cannot find any such times, you may need to switch partners—if so talk to your TA. But before you do that, I want to encourage you to reallly try hard to find two such times.<br />
