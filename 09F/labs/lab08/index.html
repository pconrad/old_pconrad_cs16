  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>In this lab, you'll learn how to write C code that can make drawings like these:</p>
  <p><img src="images/house.gif" alt="BW House" width="200" height="150"><img src="images/filledHouse.gif" alt="Color House" width="200" height="150"><img src="images/snowman.gif" alt="Snowman" width="200" height="150"><img src="images/manySnowmen.gif" alt="Many Snowmen" width="400" height="150"><img src="images/flags.gif" alt="Flags" width="400" height="150"></p>
  <p>You'll be given some basic tools to draw in either black and white, or color:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>lines</li>
    <li>boxes (outline or filled)</li>
    <li>polygons (outline or filled)</li>
    <li>circles (outline or filled)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We can also discuss, as student interests dictate, how to extend those routine to do other interesting things like</p>
  <ul>
    <li>drawing stars with any number of points, in various styles</li>
    <li>drawing arcs and curves of various kinds</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There's a program called ourDrawing.c&mdash;that's where you'll put your code this week. All the other files&mdash;you pretty much shouldn't have to make any changes to those.</p>
  <p>In ourDrawing.c, you'll use the functions provided in the other files to make your drawing.</p>
  <p>What you draw is up to you&mdash;as we'll explain in lab.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Goals for this lab</h2>
  <p>By the time you have completed this lab, you should:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>Have some comfort with working with larger software projects</li>
   <li>Have an appreciation of how computing can be fun and expressive</li>
 </ul>
 <h2>Prior Skills/Knowledge Needed</h2>
 <p>Before completing this lab, you should have completed the labs up through lab07. In particular, you should be comfortable working with arrays, structs, arrays of structs, and passing structs and arrays of structs to functions.<br>
 </p>
 <h2>This is a pair programming lab</h2>
 <p>Work with the same partner you had in lab07&mdash;or if he/she is not available for some reason, see your TA and/or instructor about getting a new pair partner assigned.</p>
 <p>If you didn't come to lab during the week of Nov 19/20, it is <strong>YOUR RESPONSIBILITY</strong> to follow up and get a pair partner assigned. </p>
 <h2>Step by Step Instructions</h2>
 <h3 id="step1">Step 0: Get together with your pair partner, and decide whose account you'll work in</h3>
 <p>If he/she is not avaialble, and you are assigned a new partner, then complete a new version of homework Assignment <a href="../../homework/H09/index.html">H09</a> including sending the email to the email address indicated.</p>
 <p>Remember: don't share passwords. Instead, use scp or email to share files with each other at the end of each work session. (See lab05, step 2 for details of how to use scp.)</p>
 <p>Ultimately, you should BOTH submit your work via the turnin program, just to be safe</p>
 <h3>Step 1: Log on to CSIL, create  ~/cs16/lab08 and copy this weeks files:</h3>

 
 <p>If you've forgotten how to create the directory, consult steps 1 and 2 from <a href="../lab01">lab01</a>.</p>
 <p>The files for this weeks lab can be found here:</p>
 <ul>
   <li><a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/cs16/09F/labs/lab08/files">http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/cs16/09F/labs/lab08/files<br>
   </a></li>
  </ul>
 <p>And here:</p>
 <p><code> ~pconrad/public_html/cs16/09F/labs/lab08/files/* </code></p>
 <p>You can use the same techniques described in lab04 to copy those into your ~/cs16/lab06 directory. Consult the instructions for lab04 if you don't remember how to do this.</p>
 <h3>Step 2: Listen to the presentation by Prof. Conrad and/or your TA.<a href="../Copy of lab07/files/airports.csv"></a></h3>
 <p>This week, there is a live presentation about the code by Prof. Conrad and/or your TA, so it is important to be at lab in person.</p>
 <p>What you are given is a collection of code containing three libraries:</p>
 <ul>
   <li><strong>shapeFunctions.c:</strong> a library of C functions for manipulating shapes, called shapeFunctions.c
     <ul>
       <li>many of these come from your lab06</li>
     </ul>
   </li>
   <li><strong>tdd.c:</strong> a library of functions for test-driven development
     <ul>
       <li>these are all functions we've seen in prevoius labs, including lab06 and lab07</li>
     </ul>
   </li>
   <li><strong>drawingFunctions.c</strong>: a library of functions for drawing simple graphics
     <ul>
       <li>these mostly rely on concepts we've seen before</li>
       <li>there are a couple of new items, which we'll briefly review
         <ul>
           <li>use of enum</li>
           <li>use of the switch statement</li>
           <li>writing files to disk (which is very similar to reading files)</li>
         </ul>
       </li>
     </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
 <p>You'll also see header files that support these C files:</p>
 <ul>
   <li><strong>shapes.h </strong>contains struct definitions for struct Point, struct Circle, struct Polygon, etc.</li>
   <li><strong>drawing.h</strong> contains struct definitions for making drawings</li>
   <li><strong>tdd.h</strong> contains function prototypes for the tdd.c functions</li>
   <li><strong>shapeFunctions.h</strong> contains function prototypes for the functions in shapeFunctions.c</li>
   <li><strong>drawingFunctions.h </strong>contains function prototypes for the functions in drawingFunctions.c</li>
  </ul>
 <p>You'll also see some programs that contain main programs that use these libraries:</p>
 <table border="2" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4">
   <tr>
     <th scope="col">file</th>
     <th scope="col">what it does</th>
     <th scope="col">sample image</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>testMain.c </td>
     <td>contains only test cases, mostly for the functions in shapeFunctions.c</td>
     <td>n/a</td>

   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>ourDrawing.c</td>

     <td><img src="images/ourDrawing.gif" alt="A blank drawing" width="400" height="150"></td>
   </tr>
 </table>
 <p>We'll also go over what happens when you type &quot;make&quot;. This week there is a Makefile that controls what happens.</p>
 <p>You'll need to understand just two things:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>typing &quot;make&quot;</li>
   <li>typing &quot;make clean&quot;</li>
 </ul>
 <h4><strong>Summary of what was presented in lab on 11/19 and 11/20</strong></h4>
 <p>To start off, type &quot;make&quot; (all by itself) at the Unix command prompt. <br>
   When you do you'll see output indicating that</p>
 <ul>
   <li> several C files are being compiled into programs</li>
   <li>some of these files are being run to produce images with .pbm extensions</li>
   <li>some commands are being run to convert those .pbm files into .gif files</li>
   <li>those .gif files are being copied to a web page</li>
   <li>some test code is being run.</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Here's an example:  </p>
 <pre>-bash-3.2$ make<br>gcc -c testMain.c<br>gcc -c drawingFunctions.c<br>gcc -c shapeFunctions.c<br>gcc -c tdd.c<br>gcc -lm -Wall -g  drawingFunctions.o shapeFunctions.o tdd.o testMain.o -o testMain<br>gcc -c drawHouse.c<br>...<br></pre><p><em>(many lines of output deleted... full transcript available in <a href="make.output.txt">make.output.txt</a>)</em></p>
   <pre>All tests passed!<br>-bash-3.2$.</pre>
   <p>The key line of output to look for is this one&mdash;except it will have your username, not jsmith&mdash;unless your username happens to be jsmith:<br>
     <br>
  <pre>Visit http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~jsmith/cs16/lab08 to see your pics</pre>
   Go to that website, and you'll see something like this:</p>
   <p><img style="border: thin solid black;" src="lab08.web.page.png" alt="lab08 web page" width="524" height="274"></p>
  <p>The drawings in that directory are the ones created by the code in the files below:</p>
  <table style="border:solid thin black;" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4">
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">GIF file</th>
      <th scope="col">C file</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>filledHouse.gif</td>
      <td>drawFilledColorHouse.c</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>flags.gif</td>
      <td>drawFlags.c</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>house.gif</td>
      <td>drawHouse.c</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>manySnowmen.gif</td>
      <td>drawManySnowmen.c</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ourDrawing.gif<br>
      <em>This is where your drawing will appear!</em></td>
      <td>ourDrawing.c<br>
        <em>This is where you put your code!</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>snowman.gif</td>
      <td>drawSnowman.gif</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <h4>The &quot;make clean&quot; command:</h4>
  <p>If your files get messed up and you want to start over, the &quot;make clean&quot; command will get rid of all the extra files is your current directory so that you can type &quot;make&quot; again from scratch.</p>
  <h4>What you need to do:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Look at the code in the C files shown above for examples of how to make drawings.
      <ul>
        <li>Compare the code to the pictures</li>
        <li>Notice how the code draws using lines, polygons and circles</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Together with your lab partner, decide what you want to draw<ul>
        <li>It should be something you can draw using lines, polygons, boxes and circles.</li>
        <li>Plan out your drawing on paper.</li>
      </ul>
</li>
    <li>Register your drawing on Gauchospace (see further instructions below in Step 5)</li>
    <li>Work on the code for your drawing (see further instructions below in Step 6)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Step 5: Registering your drawing on Gauchospace</h3>
 <p>Here's what was presented in lab on <strong>11/19 and 11/20</strong> about registering your drawing:</p>
 <p>You need to log into Gauchospace and go to the discussion form near the top of the main page labelled 'register your lab08 drawings here'.</p>
 <p>Look to see if anyone else has already registered the same item that you want to draw. You need to draw something that has not already been chosen in order to get full credit.</p>
 <p>You may make your item unique by adding a unique &quot;twist&quot;&mdash;e.g. if they are drawing a &quot;car&quot;, you can't just draw a &quot;car&quot;, but you can draw:</p>
 <ul>
   <li> a car with  a banana for a hood ornament</li>
   <li>a police car with red and blue lights</li>
   <li>a car with its hood up and steam rising from the engine.</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Step 6: Working on your drawing</h3>
 <p>To make your drawing, you put code into the file <a href="files/ourDrawing.c">ourDrawing.c</a>.</p>
 <p>The first step is to set up the function call to initDrawing with the correct parameters:</p>
 <p><strong>initDrawing(&amp;d, <em>drawing_type</em>, <em>width</em>, <em>height</em>, <em>background_color</em>);</strong></p>
 <p>The  choices you'll need to make here are:</p>
 <ol>
   <li>A black and white, or color drawing?<br>
     <br>
   If you choose black and white, then you'll use DRAWING_BW as your drawing_type, and either BW_WHITE or BW_BLACK as the background color.<br>
     <br>
   If you choose color, you'll use DRAWING_COLOR as your drawing_type, and either COLOR_WHITE, COLOR_BLACK, or one of the other choices in <a href="files/drawing.h">drawing.h</a> such as COLOR_BLUE, COLOR_YELLOW, etc. as your background color. <br>
   <br>
   You can also use any six digit hexadecimal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors">web color code</a>, preceeded by 0x, for example: 0xBDB76B is a shade of khaki.<br>
   <br>
   </li>
   <li>The size of your drawing?<br>
     <br>
   The maximum width and height are currently 512 and 512, defined in drawing.h. You may experiment with modifying the values in drawing.h if you want to make a larger drawing&mdash;but keep in mind that you may run into disk space issues if the drawing gets too big.
     </p>
 </li>
 </ol>
 <p>The next step is to add code into one of the two functions called drawShape1 and drawShape2. In each case, you should rename the function to a more sensible name such as:<br>
   <br>
  </p>
 <ul>
   <li>drawCar</li>
   <li>drawAppleTree</li>
   <li>drawSkateboard</li>
   <li>etc.</li>
  </ul>
 <p><strong>Decide what parameters the drawing functions will take. </strong></p>
 <p>At a minimum, it should take a 'reference point', and at least one dimension&mdash;a width, height, or radius&mdash;something that allows you to draw your picture at different scales.</p>
 <ul>
   <li>The reference point is some point that everything else in the drawing is calculated from.
     <ul>
       <li>It could be the center of the drawing, or the upper left corner, or the lower right corner, or the center bottom, for example </li>
       <li>What you choose as your reference point depends on the nature of what you are drawing</li>
       <li>For an ice cream cone, it might be the bottom of the cone.</li>
       <li>For a sword, it might be the place where the handle meets the blade.</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li>You should allow the user to specify at least one dimension for the picture so that you can draw it at different sizes.
     <ul>
       <li>Depending on the nature of the drawing, this might be height in pixels (e.g. for Storke Tower), or radius in pixels (e.g. for a Pizza), or width in pixels (for a flag).</li>
       <li>For some things, it may be more sensible to calculate additional dimensions from those already given, e.g.
         <ul>
           <li>calculate width automatically from the height (e.g. the width of Storke Tower might be 1/8 or 1/10 of the height, </li>
           <li>calculate height automatically from width: (e.g. the height of the US flag is the width/1.9)</li>
           <li>the length of the minute hand on a clock is 90% of the radius</li>
          </ul>
       </li>
       <li>For other things, it may be useful to specify both width and height
         <ul>
           <li>That allows you to make, for example, tall skinny houses and short fat houses.</li>
          </ul>
       </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
 <p><strong>What if my drawing has hard coded points?</strong></p>
 <p>That's ok as a starting point.</p>
 <p>Hard coded points can easily be converted into a formula with a little extra work&mdash;once you get the hang of it, it isn't that tough.</p>
 <p>A drawing with hard coded points is also ok for partial credit.</p>
 <p><strong>What if I don't <em>want</em> my drawing to have &quot;two&quot; of something on it at different sizes?</strong><br>
  <strong>Or what if my converting my complex drawing from hard coded points is going to be a major pain!</strong></p>
 <p>If you already have a drawing that you are very proud of, and you don't want to mess up the artistry, but you still want full credit, here's a work around for you. </p>
 <p>This is also a way out if you are not feeling very creative and just want to get this assignment done.</p>
 <p>Make a drawing function to draw a drawing consisting of just the initials of your first name, and that of your pair partner. For example, if Ian Smith were to partner with Frieda Jones, their drawing might be IF, and might have points like this: <br>
     <br>
  <img src="IFtag.gif" alt="IF tag" width="200" height="100"></p>
 <p>We can label these points like this:</p>
 <p><img src="IFtagPlan.png" alt="IF tag plan" width="500" height="250"></p>
 <p>And then draw this with code like the following:</p>
<pre>void drawIF(struct Drawing *d, 
	    struct Point ul, // upper left, or center bottom, or whatever
	    double width,
	    double height, 
	    int color)
{
  double letWidth = width * 0.45; // width of each letter
  double spaceBetween = width * 0.1; // space between letters
  struct Point ulI, umI, urI, llI, lmI, lrI; // I upper left, middle, right, etc.
  struct Point ulF, mlF, llF, urF, mrF;// F upper, middle, and lower left, etc.


  // set points of I across the top
  initPoint(&ulI, ul.x, ul.y);
  initPoint(&umI, ul.x + letWidth/2.0, ul.y);
  initPoint(&urI, ul.x + letWidth, ul.y);


<br>  // set points of I across the bottom
  initPoint(&llI, ul.x, ul.y + height);
  initPoint(&lmI, ul.x + letWidth/2.0, ul.y + height);
  initPoint(&lrI, ul.x + letWidth, ul.y + height);


<br>  // draw the I
  drawLine(d, ulI, urI, color); // across the top
  drawLine(d, llI, lrI, color); // across the bottom
  drawLine(d, umI, lmI, color); // down the middle

<br>  // set points of F down the left hand side, top to bottom
  initPoint(&ulF, ul.x + letWidth + spaceBetween, ul.y);
<br>etc...<br><br>}
</pre>
 <p>With this in place, you can now &quot;tag&quot; your drawing with two tags of different sizes and colors, to create an effect something like this:</p>
 <p><img src="taggedDrawing.gif" alt="Tagged Snowmen" width="300" height="150"></p>
 <p>With function calls like these:</p>
 <p>
   <pre>drawIF(&amp;d,makePoint(10,20),20,80, COLOR_RED);<br>
drawIF(&amp;d,makePoint(265,120),30,20, COLOR_GREEN)</pre>
 </p>
 <p>If you do this, then even if your main drawing is hard coded and can't be scaled, you'll get full credit for having created at least one drawing that can be scaled and relocated (i.e. your tag), and you wont have to mess up the artistic integrity of your main drawing.</p>
 <p><strong>Why having a drawing in two places at different sizes is so important</strong></p>
 <p>The reason it is so important to have a drawing element that appears at different places and with different sizes is that this shows you really understand how to apply the idea of <strong>abstraction</strong>&mdash;which is one of the central ideas in Computer Science.</p>
 <p><strong>Finishing up</strong></p>
 <p>You are ready to move on to scripting and submitting when:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>Your drawing appears on your web page at <strong>http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~yourusername/cs16/lab08/ourDrawing.gif</strong></li>
   <li>Your drawing has at least one element  that
     <ul>
       <li> appears at two different places </li>
       <li>at two different sizes, </li>
       <li>as a result of two calls to the same function with different parameters</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <h3>Step 7: Script and submit</h3>
 <p>To script and submit, create a script lab08.txt in which you:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>cd into your ~/cs16/lab08 directory and type pwd to show you are there</li>
   <li>type <strong>make clean</strong></li>
   <li>type <strong>make</strong></li>
   <li>type<strong> make clean </strong>again</li>
   <li>exit the script</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Check the web site one last time to make sure that your drawing appears there under the name <strong>http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~yourusername/cs16/lab08/ourDrawing.gif</strong>.</p>
 <p>Then, submit the contents of your lab08 directory via:</p>
 <p>turnin lab08@cs16 lab08</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
