Q1) Write the definition of a C function that takes two integers as
parameters, namely: pts and totalPts.  pts is the number of points
that a student got on an exam, and totalPts is the total number of
points the exam is worth.

The function should be called passingScore, and it should return 1 if
the students score on the exam is at least 70% (i.e. 0.7), otherwise
it should return 0.

Don't worry about totalPts being zero. But, do watch out for integer
division!
