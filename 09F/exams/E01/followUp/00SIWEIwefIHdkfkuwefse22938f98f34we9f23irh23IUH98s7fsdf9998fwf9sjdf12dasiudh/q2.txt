Q2) The function you write for Q1 takes two integers as parameters
called pts and totalPts, and returns either 1 or 0.

Write a main program that asks the user to input values for these pts
and totalPts, calls your function, and then uses the result to determine
what message to print, either:

"Pass"

or

"No Pass"

For example, you might run your program like this:

bash% ./checkScore
Please enter pts: 10
Please enter totalPts: 15
No Pass
bash% ./checkScore
Please enter pts: 12
Please enter totalPts: 15
Pass
bash%
